		<h1 class="title mb-6">About @cowsayco</h1>
		<p class="mb-4">
			@cowsayco is a community-driven project that brings daily developer humor to Twitter. The
			project combines the nostalgic charm of the classic <a
				class="cactus-link"
				href="https://github.com/tnalpgge/rank-amateur-cowsay">cowsay</a
			> command-line program from 1999 with the power of social media and modern web3 technology.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			Our vision is to build the ultimate developer quote/meme ecosystem around the Cowsay brand,
			combining daily developer quotes, merchandise, NFTs, and a sustainable token economy with
			continuous buybacks for 3 years.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">The @cowsayco community is built on these core principles:</p>
		<div class="mb-4 rounded border border-accent p-4">
			<ul class="list-inside list-disc space-y-2">
				<li>
					<strong>Community First:</strong> This is a community project. The token, NFTs, and merch are
					all tools to support and grow the community, not the other way around.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Developer Culture:</strong> We celebrate the joys, struggles, and humor of being a
					developer. Every quote, meme, and conversation reflects the real developer experience.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Transparency:</strong> All financial operations, wallet balances, and transactions
					are publicly disclosed so the community knows exactly how resources are being used.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Long-term Sustainability:</strong> We're building for the long term with a 3-year commitment,
					no quick pumps. Revenue from merchandise and NFTs supports the ecosystem, and tokenomics are
					designed to benefit long-term community members.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Fun:</strong> We bring joy and laughter to developers' daily routines, creating moments
					of happiness in the daily grind.
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h2 class="title mb-6 mt-16 text-2xl">What We Do</h2>
		<p class="mb-4">
			The @cowsayco community is built around several interconnected elements that create a fun,
			sustainable ecosystem:
		</p>

		<h3 class="title mb-4 mt-8 text-lg">Daily Developer Quotes</h3>
		<p class="mb-4">
			Our Twitter bot (@cowsayco) shares a curated developer quote every day, presented in the
			classic cowsay style. These quotes bring humor, inspiration, and relatability to developers
			around the world, creating moments of joy in the daily grind.
		</p>

		<h3 class="title mb-4 mt-8 text-lg">Discord Community</h3>
		<p class="mb-4">
			Join our Discord server to connect with fellow developers, share memes, discuss tech, and be
			part of a growing community that appreciates both coding and comedy.
		</p>

		<h3 class="title mb-4 mt-8 text-lg">NFT Auctions</h3>
		<p class="mb-4">
			Collect unique quote artwork NFTs featuring some of the most memorable developer quotes. Each
			NFT is a piece of developer culture, auctioned to support the ecosystem.
		</p>

		<h3 class="title mb-4 mt-8 text-lg">Merchandise Shop</h3>
		<p class="mb-4">
			Show your love for the community with T-shirts, mugs, mousepads, and other merchandise
			featuring @cowsayco designs. All profits contribute to the ecosystem.
		</p>

		<h3 class="title mb-4 mt-8 text-lg">$COWSAYS Token</h3>
		<p class="mb-4">
			The $COWSAYS token is part of the ecosystem, not the whole project. It's built on Solana with
			transparent tokenomics, automated buybacks from shop and NFT profits, and token burning
			mechanisms. The token serves as a way for the community to participate in and benefit from the
			growth of the @cowsayco brand.
