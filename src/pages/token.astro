		<h3 class="title mb-4 mt-8 text-lg">Long-term Vision</h3>
		<div class="mb-4 rounded border border-accent p-4">
			<p class="mb-4">
				Our commitment is to build a sustainable, community-driven ecosystem that creates lasting
				value for all participants. Over the next 3 years, we will:
			</p>
			<ul class="list-inside list-disc space-y-2">
				<li>
					<strong>Continuous value creation:</strong> All revenue from merchandise, NFTs, and partnerships
					will be reinvested into token buybacks and burns for the full 3-year period, creating a deflationary
					mechanism that benefits long-term holders
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Sustainable revenue loops:</strong> Build multiple revenue streams (merch shop, NFT
					auctions, partnerships) that continuously fund buybacks, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Community rewards:</strong> Regular airdrops to NFT holders and token stakers, ensuring
					active community members are rewarded for their support
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Ecosystem expansion:</strong> Grow the Cowsay brand through strategic partnerships,
					developer tools, and integrations that bring real utility to the token
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Community governance:</strong> Introduce governance elements that allow token holders
					to participate in key decisions about the project's direction
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Transparency & trust:</strong> Maintain complete on-chain transparency for all financial
					operations, buybacks, and distributions, building trust through verifiable actions
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Long-term commitment:</strong> The creator's 20% allocation remains locked for 3 years,
					demonstrating our dedication to the project's success and aligning incentives with the community
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="text-muted mt-4 text-sm">
				"Built for the long term, powered by the community: Cowsay forever." 🐄
			</p>
		</div>

		<h3 class="title mb-4 mt-8 text-lg">Creator Allocation (20%)</h3>
		<p class="mb-4">
			The creator holds 20% of the supply to protect the floor price from irresponsible bundles,
			maintain price stability, and demonstrate long-term commitment to the project.
		</p>
		<div class="mb-4 rounded border border-accent p-4">
			<ul class="list-inside list-disc space-y-2">
				<li>The creator holds exactly <strong>20% of total supply</strong> (200,000,000 tokens)</li>
				<li>
					<strong>No burning</strong> - all tokens are held, except for buybacks from revenue streams
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>3-year vesting lock:</strong> Tokens are locked using Streamflow for 3 years from launch,

				<li>
					<strong>Eligibility:</strong> All holders of Cowsay quote artwork NFTs are eligible to receive

				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Distribution Schedule:</strong> Airdrops will occur periodically (e.g., quarterly)
					or based on specific NFT milestones
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Allocation Method:</strong> Tokens distributed proportionally based on NFT ownership
					(e.g., one NFT = one share of the airdrop pool)
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Transparency:</strong> All airdrop transactions will be publicly recorded on-chain
					and tracked on the transparency dashboard

			<p class="text-muted mt-2 text-sm">
				Note: Specific airdrop amounts, schedules, and eligibility criteria will be announced closer

		<h2 class="title mb-6 mt-16 text-2xl">Revenue & Token Mechanics</h2>

		<h3 class="title mb-4 mt-8 text-lg">Dev Fees Distribution</h3>
		<p class="mb-4">
			All dev fees (rewards and fees) generated from the token's presence on Pump.fun are split
			<strong>50/50</strong>:
		</p>
		<div class="mb-4 rounded border border-accent p-4">
			<ul class="list-inside list-disc space-y-2">
				<li>
					<strong>Pumpfun Trading Fees:</strong> A portion of trading fees collected by Pump.fun may
					be distributed back to the token creator
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Pumpfun Rewards:</strong> Any rewards, incentives, or fee rebates received from Pump.fun
					platform
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>50% Token Burning:</strong> Half of all dev fees are used to purchase tokens from the
					market and permanently burn them, creating a deflationary mechanism that reduces the circulating
					supply over time
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>50% NFT Holder Airdrops:</strong> Half of all dev fees are used to purchase tokens
					and redistribute them to NFT holders via airdrops, rewarding the community
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Transparency:</strong> All burn and airdrop transactions are publicly recorded on-chain
					and tracked on the transparency dashboard
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h3 class="title mb-4 mt-8 text-lg">Revenue Streams & Buybacks</h3>
		<p class="mb-4">
			All profits from the following sources are automatically reinvested into token buybacks:
		</p>
		<div class="mb-4 rounded border border-accent p-4">
			<ol class="list-inside list-decimal space-y-2">
				<li>
					<strong>Merchandise Shop:</strong> All profits from T-shirts, mugs, mousepads, and other merchandise
				</li>
				<li><strong>NFT Auctions:</strong> All proceeds from auctioned quote artwork NFTs</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Future Revenue Streams:</strong> Any additional revenue generated by the Cowsay ecosystem
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p class="text-muted mb-4 text-sm">
			Note: Dev fees (Pumpfun rewards and fees) are handled separately through the 50/50 split
			strategy (see above), not through buybacks.
		</p>

		<h3 class="title mb-4 mt-8 text-lg">Revenue Distribution Summary</h3>
		<div class="mb-4 rounded border border-accent p-4">
			<ul class="list-inside list-disc space-y-2">
				<li>
					<strong>Dev Fees (Pumpfun Rewards/Fees)</strong> → <strong>50% Token Burning</strong> +
					<strong>50% NFT Holder Airdrops</strong>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Other Revenue Streams</strong> → <strong>Token Buybacks</strong> (held in treasury,
					redistributed via airdrops, or used for ecosystem rewards)
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p class="text-muted mb-4 text-sm">
			This approach ensures both supply reduction (through burns) and community rewards (through
			airdrops), creating a sustainable tokenomics model that benefits long-term holders and NFT
			collectors. A portion of buyback tokens may also be airdropped to NFT holders.
