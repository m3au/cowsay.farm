# $COWSAYS Tokenomics

## Token Overview

- **Token Name**: COWSAYS
- **Token Symbol**: $COWSAYS
- **Blockchain**: Solana
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 (1B fixed supply)

## Supply Distribution

### Creator Allocation (20%)

- The creator holds exactly **20% of total supply** (200,000,000 tokens)
- **No burning** - all tokens are held
- **3-year vesting lock**: Tokens are locked using Streamflow (popular & trusted) for 3 years from launch
- **Public commitment**: Creator vows NO SALES for 3 years from launch
- **On-chain verification**: Locked tokens are verifiable on-chain from day 1

### Public Distribution (80%)

- Remaining 80% of supply (800,000,000 tokens) available for public trading
- Distribution via fair bonding curve + DEX listing
- Community distribution through DEX trading

### NFT Holder Airdrops

- **Eligibility**: All holders of Cowsay quote artwork NFTs are eligible to receive token airdrops
- **Distribution Source**: Airdrops will be funded from:
  - 50% of dev fees (Pumpfun rewards/fees)
  - A portion of buyback tokens from shop/NFT revenue
  - Or from a dedicated allocation within the public distribution
- **Distribution Schedule**: Airdrops will occur periodically (e.g., quarterly) or based on specific NFT milestones
- **Allocation Method**: Tokens distributed proportionally based on NFT ownership (e.g., one NFT = one share of the airdrop pool)
- **On-chain Records**: All airdrop transactions will be publicly recorded on-chain
- **Purpose**: Reward early NFT collectors and holders for their support of the Cowsay ecosystem

**Note**: Specific airdrop amounts, schedules, and eligibility criteria will be announced closer to the first NFT launch and will be updated as the ecosystem evolves.

## Supply Control Strategy

The creator holds 20% of the supply to:

- Protect the floor price from irresponsible bundles
- Maintain price stability
- Demonstrate long-term commitment to the project

This allocation is secured with a 3-year vesting lock using Streamflow (popular and trusted platform), providing on-chain proof of the commitment from day 1. This protects the floor price, stabilizes the market, and demonstrates diamond hands commitment.

## Dev Fees Distribution

### Pumpfun Rewards & Fees

All dev fees (rewards and fees) generated from the token's presence on Pump.fun are split **50/50**:

- **Pumpfun Trading Fees**: A portion of trading fees collected by Pump.fun may be distributed back to the token creator
- **Pumpfun Rewards**: Any rewards, incentives, or fee rebates received from Pump.fun platform
- **50% Token Burning**: Half of all dev fees are used to purchase tokens from the market and permanently burn them, creating a deflationary mechanism that reduces the circulating supply over time
- **50% NFT Holder Airdrops**: Half of all dev fees are used to purchase tokens and redistribute them to NFT holders via airdrops, rewarding the community
- **On-chain Records**: All burn and airdrop transactions are publicly recorded on-chain

### Revenue Distribution Summary

- **Dev Fees (Pumpfun Rewards/Fees)** → **50% Token Burning** + **50% NFT Holder Airdrops**
- **Other Revenue Streams** → **Token Buybacks** (held in treasury, redistributed via airdrops, or used for ecosystem rewards)

This approach ensures both supply reduction (through burns) and community rewards (through airdrops), creating a sustainable tokenomics model that benefits long-term holders and NFT collectors. A portion of buyback tokens may also be airdropped to NFT holders (see NFT Holder Airdrops section above).

## Revenue Streams & Buybacks

All profits from the following sources are automatically reinvested into token buybacks:

1. **Merchandise Shop**: All profits from T-shirts, mugs, mousepads, and other merchandise
2. **NFT Auctions**: All proceeds from auctioned quote artwork NFTs
3. **Future Revenue Streams**: Any additional revenue generated by the Cowsay ecosystem

**Note**: Dev fees (Pumpfun rewards and fees) are handled separately through the 50/50 split strategy (see above), not through buybacks.

### Buyback Execution

- All buyback transactions are publicly recorded on-chain
- Weekly/monthly buyback execution based on available profits

## Long-term Vision

- **3-year commitment**: Creator will not sell their 20% allocation for 3 years
- **Continuous buybacks**: All revenue reinvested into the token for 3 years
- **Community growth**: Focus on building a sustainable ecosystem around the Cowsay brand

## Additional Notes

- Token contract address will be published after launch
- All wallet addresses and commitments are publicly disclosed
- All transactions are publicly visible on-chain via Solana explorer
