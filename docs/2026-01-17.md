## Plans

### Meeting with Kosi

• I’ll create and share two posts per week using engaging, eye-catching graphics to communicate the project’s mission and vision.
• I’ll also organize fun, interactive promotional campaigns and events that spark curiosity and excitement, helping attract more people and grow the community.
• I’ll actively represent the project on X (Twitter) by joining relevant Spaces to promote and discuss the project, as well as hosting my own Spaces to further expand its reach and visibility.
here’s what to expect in terms of results:

➠ Growth in both X followers and the discord  community
➠ Achieve 10k+ post impressions per week(meaning the posts made on the official account would get solid interactions seeing we’re building both the community on X and discord  )
➠ Get solid investors and whales  into the project
➠ create and build an active community on the discord
➠ I can also get us partnerships with some other projects I work with to expand our reach
