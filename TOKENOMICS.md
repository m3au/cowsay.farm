# $COWSAYS Tokenomics

## Token Overview

- **Token Name**: COWSAYS
- **Token Symbol**: $COWSAYS
- **Blockchain**: Solana
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 (1B fixed supply)

## Supply Distribution

### Creator Allocation (20%)

- The creator holds exactly **20% of total supply** (200,000,000 tokens)
- **No burning** - all tokens are held
- **10-year vesting lock**: Tokens are locked using Streamflow (popular & trusted) for 10 years from launch
- **Public commitment**: Creator vows NO SALES for 10 years from launch
- **On-chain verification**: Locked tokens are verifiable on-chain from day 1

### Public Distribution (80%)

- Remaining 80% of supply (800,000,000 tokens) available for public trading
- Distribution via fair bonding curve + DEX listing
- Community distribution through DEX trading

## Supply Control Strategy

The creator holds 20% of the supply to:

- Protect the floor price from irresponsible bundles
- Maintain price stability
- Demonstrate long-term commitment to the project

This allocation is secured with a 10-year vesting lock using Streamflow (popular and trusted platform), providing on-chain proof of the commitment from day 1. This protects the floor price, stabilizes the market, and demonstrates diamond hands commitment.

## Token Burning Strategy

### Pumpfun Rewards & Fees

All rewards and fees generated from the token's presence on Pump.fun are dedicated to **permanent token burning**:

- **Pumpfun Trading Fees**: A portion of trading fees collected by Pump.fun may be distributed back to the token creator
- **Pumpfun Rewards**: Any rewards, incentives, or fee rebates received from Pump.fun platform
- **Burning Mechanism**: All pumpfun-derived funds are used to purchase tokens from the market and permanently burn them
- **Supply Reduction**: This creates a deflationary mechanism that reduces the circulating supply over time
- **Transparency**: All burn transactions are publicly recorded on-chain and tracked on the transparency dashboard

### Burning vs Buybacks

- **Pumpfun Rewards/Fees** → **Token Burning** (permanent supply reduction)
- **Other Revenue Streams** → **Token Buybacks** (held in treasury or redistributed)

This dual approach ensures both supply reduction (through burns) and price support (through buybacks), creating a sustainable tokenomics model that benefits long-term holders.

## Revenue Streams & Buybacks

All profits from the following sources are automatically reinvested into token buybacks:

1. **Merchandise Shop**: All profits from T-shirts, mugs, mousepads, and other merchandise
2. **NFT Auctions**: All proceeds from auctioned quote artwork NFTs
3. **Future Revenue Streams**: Any additional revenue generated by the Cowsay ecosystem

**Note**: Pumpfun rewards and fees are handled separately through the token burning strategy (see above), not through buybacks.

### Buyback Transparency

- All buyback transactions are publicly recorded on-chain
- Real-time tracking available on the transparency dashboard
- Weekly/monthly buyback execution based on available profits

## Long-term Vision

- **10-year commitment**: Creator will not sell their 20% allocation for 10 years
- **Continuous buybacks**: All revenue reinvested into the token for 10 years
- **Community growth**: Focus on building a sustainable ecosystem around the Cowsay brand

## Additional Notes

- Token contract address will be published after launch
- All wallet addresses and commitments are publicly disclosed
- Full transparency on all financial operations through the transparency dashboard
